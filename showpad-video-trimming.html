				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>Showpad Video was introduced to offer a way for sales people to engage with prospective buyers in a post-COVID world.</p>

				<p>With it, Showpad users can record a video clip from anywhere within the Showpad platform, showcase any of the assets provided by their marketing teams, share it via any of the several sharing options, and get analytics on how their video is performing.</p>

				<p>Upon joining Showpad, I had the great fortune of joining the Video team — one of the smallest teams in the company, but also one of the most agile and best performing.</p>

				<h2>Problem</h2>

				<p>It’s not uncommon for something unexpected to happen while you’re recording a video. Your cat may jump into frame, you may get an unexpected call, maybe you forgot that word that’s just on the tip to your tongue…</p>

				<p>Unfortunately for Showpad Video users, there was no easy way to cut out any of those from your video — you had to delete your recording and start all over again.</p>

				<p>Using the <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank">Jobs to Be Done</a> framework, we arrived at the following goal:</p>

				<blockquote class="jtbd">As <u>a sales user</u>, I want to be able to <u>trim and delete parts from my videos</u> in order to <u>have a professional looking video without having to rerecord several times</u>.</blockquote>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>Even though the general composition was in place from very early on, the interface went through several rounds of iterations to refine and ensure that the final experience was as intuitive as possible.</p>

				<h3>Ease of use</h3>

				<h3>Accuracy</h3>

				<h3>First time experience</h3>

				<p>We went through several rounds of refinement and validation. Because this was a brand new piece of functionality, we created a guide to help teach users how to make the most of it. Check the features and guide for yourself below:</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>

				<p>Video Trimming was a major release for Showpad Video and received a significant marketing push. Reception was great, with many customers saying this feature solved their biggest hurdle in adopting Showpad Video, which saw an increase in usage as a result, inline with the success metrics defined early on in the project.</p>
