				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>During the big <a href="integrate-new-web-app.html">web app redesign project of 2020</a>, one of our goals was to introduce to the platform a new, streamlined way for people to create anything — from campaigns to user accounts.</p>

			</section>

			<section>

				<h2>Problem</h2>

				<p>The goal was quite simple:</p>

				<blockquote class="jtbd">As <u>Megan Marketing</u>, I want to be able to <u>easily create anything</u> in order to <u>get value out of the product</u>.</blockquote>

			</section>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>We quickly arrived at a simple solution that was flexible enough to accommodate our needs, we still wanted to put it in front of people to make sure it was bulletproof.</p>

				<img src="assets/integrate/builder-structure.png" class="img-full integrate" alt="Three screenshots showing the base structure for the builder with a three-stepped process">
				<figcaption>The base structure for our builder.</figcaption>


				<p>Still, we didn’t want people to focus on the specifics of what the test would have them do, so my Product Manager (hi <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-henderson-product-manager/">Emma</a>!) and I put our thinking hats on to try and find a way to make them focus on the builder itself.</p>

				<p>We quickly agreed that the test should involve creating something that’s not on the platform — but what? And can we make it something fun, so that people enjoy taking part in the test and feel more at ease going through it?</p>

				<p>And then we remembered the hedgehog, the company’s unofficial mascot: what if the test was picking the right outfit for our mascot?</p>

				<figcaption>Poor hedgehog needs some threads ASAP.</figcaption>

				<p>I put some illustrations together and built the prototype. At this point we had many of the components needed for this UI, so we were able to do a relatively high fidelity prototype for people to play with.</p>

				<p>We defined a goal and put it in front of people. Can you complete this task?</p>

				<div class="frame-container web">
					<div class="helper">
						<p><i class="fas fa-hand-pointer"></i> Prototype</p>
					</div>

					<a class="play-trigger" href="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/2ce5a67e-d4bd-44d9-a195-88dddebdc2f6-79b6/?fullscreen&hints=off" target="prototypeHedgehog"><i class="fas fa-play"></i></a>

					<iframe width="360" height="640" name="prototypeHedgehog" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>


				<figcaption>A small portion of the prototype we used to validate this project.</figcaption>

				<div class="info prototype">
					<p><b>Can you complete the task?</b> Click the icon on the bottom left if you need a reminder of what the goal is.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				
				<p>We got a lot of positive feedback during the sessions and ended up making some changes to reflect some of the feedback we got (mostly to do with how we handle skipping steps).</p>				

				<p>Still, the biggest outcome of these sessions for me was that <b>user testing doesn't have to be boring</b>. 😁</p>
