			<h4>Q1 2015</h4>
			<h1>Bringing SMARKIO to Market</h1>
		</section>

		<section>

			<div class="img-full smarkio">

			</div>

			<p>I joined the SMARKIO team in January 2015 to help prepare for a big product launch that was to happen later in the year.</p>

			<p>SMARKIO was a sister company to Adclick, which I had joined a year prior as a Visual Designer. The product was to be comprised of a series of disparate tools developed for internal use to manage several types of marketing campaigns at Adclick but bundled into one single automated marketing suite.</p>

			<p>During the months leading up to the launch, I had several objectives:</p>

		</section>

		<section>

			<h3>Defining the personas and their activities</h3>

			<p>A lot of research was done to <b>define the personas that would be using the product</b>. This involved looking into how the tools were being used internally at Adclick and having many conversations with potential customers and early-access users.</p>

			<p>In the end, we identified the three key personas:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <b>Marketing Supervisor</b>, who uses the product to monitor the overall performance of their marketing department</li>
				<li>The <b>Marketing Executive</b>, who uses the product to set up their marketing campaigns and review their performance</li>
				<li>The <b>Developer</b>, who embeds the code in the site and/or develops campaign assets</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This led to a focus on the user experience for the Marketing Executives and an additional layer of reporting and dashboards for the Marketing Supervisor.</p>

		</section>

		<section>

			<h3>Re-contextualise all the different tools</h3>

			<p>Seeing that all the tools had been developed independently of each other, <b>it was important for the product to present them in a way that made sense to the end-user</b>.</p>

			<p>We studied the different tools and their different synergies, and ended up splitting them into the chart:</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th class="hidden"></th>
					<th>On-site</th>
					<th>Off-site</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Content</td>
					<td>
						<span>Form</span>
						<span>Chat</span>
						<span>Click to call</span>
					</td>
					<td>
						<span>Email</span>
						<span>SMS</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Distribution method</td>
					<td>
						<span>Overlay</span>
						<span>Dynamic content</span>
					</td>
					<td>
						<span>Workflow</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Management and monitoring</td>
					<td colspan="2">
						<span>Lead management</span>
						<span>Reporting</span>
						<span>Websites</span>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>This helped us <b>organise the tools in a more logical sense</b> and also helped us <b>promote and suggest combinations for users who were not making full use of the entire suite</b>.</p>

		<section>

			<h3>Improve the user experience</h3>

			<p>Since the initial tools had been developed by internal use only, there was little time spent accounting for their ease of use.</p>

			<p>To fix this, I made an effort to <b>improve the user experience</b> by introducing well-established patterns like wizard interfaces when creating new campaigns and spending time making the UI as consistent as possible using a proto-design system.</p>

			<figcaption>Some of the things put in place: a wizard with validation, a grid layout, and flyouts.</figcaption>

			<p>In the end, our product was a lot more user friendly than before, which led to less time spent by the account managers helping their accounts set up their campaigns.</p>

		</section>

		<section>

			<h3>Validate, validate, validate</h3>

			<p>During this time, I <b>met with users regularly</b> to get a bigger understanding of their problems and their goals, to validate our solutions, and to gather insights on how they were using the product.</p>
