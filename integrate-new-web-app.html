				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>In Q3 2020, we started working on a brand new web platform â€” blank slate, new codebase, new visual design language.</p>

				<p>It was something that I had been looking forward to ever since I had joined the company 3 years prior but, as exciting as this opportunity was, it was also daunting: just two Product Managers and one Product Designer to redesign an entire new platform? Oh boy.</p>

			</section>

			<section>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>Naturally, we started with wireframes and refined them through numerous validation sessions we conducted internally and externally.</p>

				<img src="#TODO.png" alt="#TODO">
				<figcaption>Wireframes used for validating problems and solutions.</figcaption>

				<p>Almost simultaneously, we were experimenting with directions weâ€™d take the visual design on. We eventually settled for a simple and utilitarian approach that would help us create a consistent look and iterate quickly.</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>

				<p>Eventually, as we designed more and more pages (and had some fun validating them), the new platform took shape:</p>

				<img src="#TODO.png" alt="#TODO">
				<figcaption>The event monitoring page surfaces all the information you'd need to see how a live event is going.</figcaption>

				<img src="#TODO.png" alt="#TODO">
				<figcaption>Our leads page offers loads of information and ways to filter and process information.</figcaption>

				<img src="#TODO.png" alt="#TODO">
				<figcaption>The lead profile page lets users see all information pertaining to a lead â€” from their qualifying data to all the steps they go in after collection.</figcaption>

				<img src="#TODO.png" alt="#TODO">
				<figcaption>The new builder is intuitive and flexible. <a href="integrate-fun-user-testing.html">Read about how we ran our user testing.</a></figcaption>

				<p>As Iâ€™m wring these words, these pages are currently being implemented by our talented engineering team, and I canâ€™t wait until I get to play with the final product.</p>
