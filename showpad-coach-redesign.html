				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>Courses and learning are one of the key offerings of the Showpad product. These came originally through the acquisition of LearnCore in 2018, well before I joined the company.</p>

				<p>After the success of our <a href="showpad-video-backgrounds">Showpad</a> <a href="showpad-video-redesign">Video</a> <a href="showpad-video-trimming">projects</a>, our team grew by a few people and was assigned a timeboxed project: to redesign the learning experience.</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				
				<h2>Problem</h2>

				<p>For several reasons, the experience of going through a course in Showpad didn’t change much between the acquisition of LearnCore and when I joined the company. That’s around four years without much care or attention  — there was a lot of work to be done.</p>

				<p>Many of the issues people had were well documented, which saved us a lot of time when it came to problem validation.</p>

				<p>Most of the problems stemmed from a busy interface with confusing informational hierarchy, unclear navigation, little guidance, etc. Here's some direct quotes from customers.</p>

				<blockquote>“I always found strange that [...] we are mixing all information on the right panel.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>"[The] navigation is too nested.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>“I would expect to see information laid out in a left-to-right layout.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>“Understanding progression is very difficult.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>“I found it confusing that to go through the slides in a course I need to scroll. I kept clicking the arrow and missing content.”</blockquote>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>Even though the scope was relatively larger than what he had done with the Showpad Video redesign, we decided to employ a similar strategy: divide and conquer.</p>

				<p>So once again, we mapped the user journey, assigned every issue identified during our research, and split it into chunks we could confidently tackle.</p>

				<h2>Final designs</h2>

				<p>After many (many) rounds of iteration and validation, we arrived at a design that we felt quite confident about. Here are some of the highlights:</p>

				<h3>Course overview</h3>

				<p>The course overview is where you see the entire contents of a course. It's the first screen you seen when you're assigned or decide to take a course.</p>

				<div class="before-after-container-new old-new-toggle">
					<img src="assets/showpad/coach-overview-old.png" class="before" alt="">
					<img src="assets/showpad/coach-overview-new.png" alt="">
					<div class="dot progress">1</div>
					<div class="dot hierarchy">2</div>
					<div class="dot overview">3</div>
					<div class="helper">
						<p>New</p>
						<div class="toggle">
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<p>Old</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Made it easier to track progress</b>, even while learning.</p>

				<p class="before-after"><span>2</span><b>Made it easier to parse information</b> by removing clutter and being considerate about visual hierarchy.</p>

				<p class="before-after"><span>3</span><b>Removed the need for a separate overview page</b> by making it a different state of the learning UI.</p>
				

				<h3>Learning</h3>

				<p>This is the core experience of Showpad Coach — going through a course. Navigation should be as intuitive and frictionless as possible, and the content should take centre stage.</p>

				<div class="before-after-container-new old-new-toggle">
					<img src="assets/showpad/coach-ui-old.png" class="before" alt="">
					<img src="assets/showpad/coach-ui-new.png" alt="">
					<div class="dot contents">1</div>
					<div class="dot navigation">2</div>
					<div class="dot next">3</div>
					<div class="helper">
						<p>New</p>
						<div class="toggle">
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<p>Old</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Decluttered the table of contents and moved it to the left</b> to better follow the left-to-right reading direction.</p>

				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Fixed the navigation</b> by anchoring it to the bottom of the page and lablelling the buttons clearly.</p>

				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Gave clearer guidance on what’s next.</b> Asset thumbnails were maintained but only shown when needed.</p>

				<h3>Testing and pitching</h3>

				<p>Testing and pitching (pictured below) are tools to assess and review the content learnt through Showpad Coach.</p>

				<div class="before-after-container-new old-new-toggle">
					<img src="assets/showpad/coach-pitch-old.png" class="before" alt="">
					<img src="assets/showpad/coach-pitch-new.png" alt="">
					<div class="dot prepare">1</div>
					<div class="dot recording">2</div>
					<div class="dot draft">3</div>
					<div class="helper">
						<p>New</p>
						<div class="toggle">
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<p>Old</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Removed pitch guidance</b> and presented instead in its own separate page.</p>

				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Improved the recording experience</b> by leveraging some of the improvements introduced on the <a href="showpad-video-redesign.html">Showpad Video redesign project</a>.</p>

				<p class="before-after"><span>1</span><b>Better draft management</b> with a completely new experience.</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>

				<p>Progress on this project was unfortunately pushed back after the team was severely impacted by the Showpad layoffs of late 2022.</p>

				<p>After a rocky period, progress has resumed and we're hoping to make this redesign available as a beta for select customers at the end of Q1 2023.</p>
