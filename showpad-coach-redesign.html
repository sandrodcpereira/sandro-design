				<h2>Context</h2>

				<p>Courses and learning are one of the key offerings of the Showpad product. These came originally through the acquisition of LearnCore in 2018, well before I joined the company.</p>

				<p>After the success of our <a href="showpad-video-backgrounds">Showpad</a> <a href="showpad-video-redesign">Video</a> <a href="showpad-video-trimming">projects</a>, our team grew by a few people and was assigned a timeboxed project: to redesign the learning experience.</p>

			</section>

				<h2>Problem</h2>

				<p>For several reasons, the experience of going through a course in Showpad didn’t change much between the acquisition of LearnCore and when I joined the company. That’s around four years without much care or attention  — there was a lot of work to be done.</p>

				<p>Many of the issues people had were well documented, which saved us a lot of time when it came to problem validation.</p>

				<p>Most of the problems stemmed from a busy interface with confusing informational hierarchy, unclear navigation, little guidance, etc. Here's some direct quotes from customers.</p>

				<blockquote>“I always found strange that [...] we are mixing all information on the right panel.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>"[The] navigation is too nested.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>“I would expect to see information laid out in a left-to-right layout.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>“Understanding progression is very difficult.”</blockquote>

				<blockquote>“I found it confusing that to go through the slides in a course I need to scroll. I kept clicking the arrow and missing content.”</blockquote>

				<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

				<p>Even though the scope was relatively larger than what he had done with the Showpad Video redesign, we decided to employ a similar strategy: divide and conquer.</p>

				<p>So once again, we mapped the user journey, assigned every issue identified during our research, and split it into chunks we could confidently tackle.</p>

				<h2>Final designs</h2>

				<p>After many rounds of iteration and validation, we ended up with the following offering:</p>

					<div class="dot one">1</div>
					<div class="dot two">2</div>
					<div class="dot three">3</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>

				<p>Progress on this project was unfortunately pushed back after the team was severely impacted by the Showpad layoffs of late 2022.</p>

				<p>After a rocky period, progress has resumed and we're hoping to make this redesign available as a beta for select customers at the end of Q1 2023.</p>
