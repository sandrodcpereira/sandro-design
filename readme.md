# Sandro Pereira's online portfolio

Hello, my name is Sandro Pereira and this is my online portfolio. I'm writing this mostly for my benefit, because I tend to forget things. Documentation is important!

## What I am using

* [Less](http://lesscss.org), because variables and nested styles make things easier.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com), readymade icons save you a tonne of work.

## How to compile CSS

Forgot how many times I forgot how to do this and had to fumble online to remember. Fuck.

Here's how you do it, you dummy:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to your repository.
2. Type `less-watch-compiler src prod style.less` and press enter.
3. All done, your Less file is now being watched. Cool.

This obviously assumes that Less has been installed already, but that's a one time thing and it's easy enough to do.

## How to run the page locally

Crap, I forget this all the fucking time, too. It's easy, though.

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the repository you want to host locally.
2. Type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` and press enter. 
3. Cool beans. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to visit the page.

Other addresses work too, obviously.
