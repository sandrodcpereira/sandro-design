		</section>

		<section>

			<h2>Hi! My name is Sandro Pereira, and I'm a product designer based in London.</h2>

			<div class="info">
				<p>Fun fact: Pereira is the Portuguese word for "pear tree."</p>
			</div>

			<p>I knew from an early age that I'd end up in a creative field. My favourite activities as a kid were drawing and building LEGO â€” the more open-ended and inventive the pursuit, the better.</p>

			<p>A few years later, I started to connect the dots between software and visual design while playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_(video_game)" target="_blank">Wipeout</a> on my PlayStation. I couldn't believe how sleek and futuristic everything felt. I didn't quite know what the job title would end up being, but I knew that's what I wanted to do for a living.</p>

			<p>I started my career doing freelance jobs here and there, during the rise of smartphones and skeuomorphism. I designed so many iPhone app icons you wouldn't believe. Eventually, after having entered the world of mobile apps through the iconography door, I started to dabble in user interface design and learnt as I went.</p>

			<p>I got my first full-time job as a visual designer at Adclick, a marketing agency, but was quick to take the opportunity to move to a product role when the company decided to bring a product to market. I joined the SMARKIO team and launched my first <abbr title="Business to Business">B2B</abbr> <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> product. Hooray! ðŸš€</p>

			<p>Two years later, I decided it was time for a big change. I got the opportunity to join <a href="https://www.instagram.com/akkroo" target="_blank">Akkroo</a>, a small start-up in London dealing with event lead capture. New job, new country, new opportunities. </p>

			<p>The journey with Akkroo has been immensely rewarding and a fantastic learning opportunity. To go from a team of barely over ten to a team of over fifty, and then through an acquisition, has been quite the journey, and I'm very proud to have played a significant role in it.</p>

			<p>Throughout the years, I've made many friends with my colleagues (a great deal of them software engineers, probably because of how closely together we work), and that has led to almost as many ideas and side projects. Seriously â€” the ones I've listed on the main page are just a small fraction of them.</p>

			<p>If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach me at any of my social media accounts or via email at <a href="mailto:hello@sandro.design?subject=CV Request">hello@sandro.design</a>. Thank you for the visit and for taking the time to read this!</p>
