			<h4>Q4 2018</h4>
			<h1>Akkroo App — Major Product Update</h1>
			

		</header>

		<section>

			<h2>User interface</h2>

			<h3>App</h3>

			Here's the persona we're designing for:

			<div class="card">
				<h3>Serena Sales</h3>
				<p>Serena is usually pretty cool, but if you happen to find her in a stressful context she will turn into a crazy lady. Steer clear!</p>
			</div>

			<p>During my current tenure at Akkroo, I've been involved in two major reworkings of the Akkroo app.</p>

			<p>The first one, released in Q4 2017, introduced a revamped user flow and the ability to view and edit collected information — something customers had been asking for quite some time. This required months of research, design, and validation, and allowed us to lay the groundwork to provide a better user experience for our users.</p>

			<p>The second one, released in Q3 2018, was a move to a brand new React Native codebase. This move allowed for better performance and faster development times. Because we had introduced completely new user flows less than a year prior, we avoided making any big changes to the app, choosing instead to focus on the details and interactions to streamline the existing flows.</p>

			<p>The new app has been very well received and has been continuously improved over the past few months. Here's a few comments from customers:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"Excellent app to use!! Quick and easy to get details for customers"</p>
			</blockquote>

			<cite>— Vicky C.</cite>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"Awesome easy to use"</p>
			</blockquote>

			<cite>— James H.</cite>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"A lot more user-friendly than our previous system. Very quick, easy and convenienet to just pull out your phone and scan a badge [...]"</p>
			</blockquote>

			<cite>— Vince R.</cite>

			<h3>Dashboard</h3>

			<p class="info">
				This is an info box. It can have a tonne of text or maybe only one line. This one will have a few, I guess.
			</p>

			<p>While most of my design work at Akkroo has been focused on the app, I have worked on a few additions and improvements to the dashboard, including the Success Hub, an onboarding page for new customers and repository of useful resources.</p>

			<h2>Marketing</h2>

			<!--h3>Website</h3>

			<p>My first big project at Akkroo was to refresh and update the existing website. Click <a href="https://akkroo.com" target="_blank">here</a> to visit the website.</p-->

			<h3>Landing pages</h3>

			<p>During my first few months at Akkroo, I was also responsible for designing and implementing a few Hubspot landing pages, which proved to be a great opportunity to experiment a bit with a more illustrative style and some simple animations.</p>

			<!--h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

			<h3>Illustration</h3>

			<p>Illustration is a big part of the Akkroo brand, especially internally and for existing customers. I have personally drawn numerous assets, from simple icons to empty state imagery.</p-->

			<!--h2>Animation</h2>

			<p>One of the big marketing pieces we developed at Akkroo was a 1:30 minute illustrated video to get prospects familiar with our product. This project was brought to life along with filmmaker <a target="_blank" href="http://finnsims.com">Finn Sims</a>.</p>
