			<h2>The event</h2>

			<p>DotFetch is a prototype developed at the very first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1800599470197285/" target="_blank">external hackathon organised by Farfetch</a>. It was held in a built for purpose structure in downtown Porto, in 2016.</p>

			<p>The goal was for teams to try and come up with potential new sources of revenue for the business.</p>

			<h2>The team</h2>

			<p>My team was comprised of friends from work:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anacarolinacorreia/">Carolina Correia</a>, digital marketer</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmsborges/">Pedro Borges</a>, software engineer</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagomarquesmota/">Tiago Mota</a>, software engineer</li>
				<li>And me, product designer</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The idea</h2>

			<p>Our objective was to make it easy for people to buy things they saw while browsing the web, closing the gap between the browsing and the shopping experience.</p>

			<p>Our solution took shape into a browser extension that the user would open whenever they saw a piece of clothing and outfit that they liked and, through the magic of scraping the information on the page and a fairly advanced image recognition system (for the time), would return the same or similar items on the Farfetch storefront that could immediately add to their cart and purchase — all without having to navigate to a different page.</p>

			[insert deck]

			<p>The prototype we built during the 24 hours we had managed to impress the judges and we were awarded 3rd place out of 36 teams.</p>
