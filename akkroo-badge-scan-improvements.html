			<h1>Badge Scanning Improvements in the Akkroo App</h1>
			

		</header>

		<section>

			<div class="img-full">
				<img src="assets/generic/placeholder.png" alt="">
			</div>

			<h2>Context</h2>

			<p>After the launch of the new <a href="akkroo-react-native-app.html">Akkroo app built on React Native</a>, there was a big focus on improving existing features and providing a more seamless experience for our app users. One piece of functionality that was severely improved was the badge scanner.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest issues app users encountered when using our app was the perception of having lost data when an action was performed incorrectly — maybe they scanned the wrong QR code in an event badge, or their marketing manager forgot to correctly set up an integration with the badge provider. On both of those instances, the scan would not return any data, thus “losing” the lead and the opportunity for our sales user.</p>	

			<p>These scenarios could be classified as user errors, but the user perception was that the Akkroo app had failed to retrieve the badge data, resulting in anxiety and lack of confidence in the product. </p>

		</section>

		<section>
			
			<h2>Problem</h2>

			<p>We framed this project around the user persona of the Sales Representative, who is the typical user of the Akkroo app.</p> 

			<p>Using the <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done" target="_blank">Jobs to Be Done</a> framework, we arrived at the following goal:</p>

			<blockquote class="jtbd">As <u>Serena Sales</u>, I want to be able to <u>know I have scanned the right badge</u> in order to <u>trust that the Akkroo app will retrieve the data contained within</u>.</blockquote>

		</section>

		<section>
			
			<h2>Discovery and ideation</h2>

			<p>We tackled this challenge by implementing three different solutions that, in the end, provided peace of mind to our users by assuring them that:</p>


			<div class="row">

				<img src="assets/temp/badge 1.png" alt="">

				<div class="text">
					<h3>1. There is a badge provider integration in place</h3>

					<p>By warning users when there is no integration in place, we can manage their expectations by letting them know we won’t be able to retrieve data from badges unless that problem is addressed, giving them an opportunity to do so.</p>

				</div>


			</div>

			<p class="info">Scanning badges without an integration is an existing, albeit rare, use case, meaning that we still needed to allow users to do it in those scenarios.</p>

			<div class="row">
				
				<!--img src="assets/temp/badge 3.png" alt=""-->

				<video controls="true" autoplay loop muted playsinline poster="assets/temp/badge 2.png">
				    <source type="video/mp4" src="assets/temp/demo.mp4">
				    <!--img src="assets/temp/badge 2.png"-->
				</video>


				<div class="text">
					<h3>2. They have scanned the correct code</h3>

					<p>When using the scanner in the app, we employ real-time validation to assure the user that they are scanning the right kind of code and that the string retrieved is in the expected format.</p>

					<p>This helps us avoid scenarios in which the wrong badges are scanned, leaving Akkroo with no way to retrieve data for that lead.</p>
				</div>

			</div>


			<div class="row">
				
				<img src="assets/temp/badge 4.png" alt="">

				<div class="text">
					<h3>3. The badge contains data</h3>

					<p>By returning the badge data in real-time, we eliminate the users’ anxiety of wondering whether the badge contained real data or not. By surfacing the information immediately, the users can confirm they scanned the correct badge, that it contained information, and even make additions or corrections.</p>
				</div>

			</div>

			<div class="row">
				
				<img src="assets/temp/badge 5.png" alt="">

				<div class="text">
					<h3>Bonus: NFC badge support</h3>

					<p>In addition to these improvements, we’ve also added the ability to scan <abbr title="Near-Field Communication">NFC</abbr> badges, a much requested feature, by plugging it into our existing badge data infrastructure.</p>
				</div>

			</div>

			<h2>Outcome</h2>

			<div class="img-full">
				<img src="assets/generic/placeholder.png" alt="The Success Hub">
			</div>

			<p>This project is a great example of how you can supercharge a feature just by focusing on the possible points of failure and making sure to design for when those happen.</p>

			<p>By doing so, you’re assuring the user that you got their backs and that they can trust your product to be an ally and prevent them from making mistakes.</p>

			<p><b>Value added:</b></p>

			<ul class="value">


				<li>Assuring users they have a badge scan integration set up.</li>
				<li>Assuring users they are scanning the right badge.</li>
				<li>Assuring users the badge they scanned contained data.</li>
				<li>Enabling users to scan <abbr title="Near-Field Communication">NFC</abbr> badges in addition to <abbr title="Quick Response">QR</abbr> and barcode badges.</li>
